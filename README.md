French-text-analyzer

The python program is made to analyze a .txt file and tell you the letters' frequency or the words' one. It basically will have some features just like the text editor in linux terminal nano.

This script could be useful to optimize a keyboard layout by knowing the high frequency letters and words given by the user through a .txt file : you're a French native person but you also chat a lot in English and code in JavaScript, so you can create a .txt file with 40% of French, 40% of JavaScript code and finally 20% of English. By using this script you will have the required metrics to build or edit your perfect keyboard layout.

I would like to had the feature of a layout creator, the program won't just give metrics but also propose a complete keyboard layout. Still a lot of code to write…
