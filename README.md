# text-analyzer

That python program is made to analyze a .txt file and tell you the letters' and words' frequency. This script will allow a powerful optimization of a keyboard layout.

Example of application : you're a French native but you also chat a lot in English and code in JavaScript, so you drop a .txt file into the programm with 40% of French, 40% of JavaScript code and 20% of English. By using this script you will have the required metrics to build or edit your perfect keyboard layout (and even a keyboard map probably).
